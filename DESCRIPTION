Description: Cell type compositions are estimated from gene
    therapy data.  The data are in the form of a N by K table of
    counts for number of cells in each of N cell lineages for which K
    types are assessed.  The model uses a Dirchlet process prior that
    has a Dirichlet distribution as its base.  The K cell types are
    subject to misclassification and a confusion matrix must be given
    a priori.
